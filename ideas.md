# GMTK - GameJam 2k18

## Subject :
_Make a game based on a genre, and remvoed one of its core mecanics._

## Idea : ___A strategy game, without an opponent.___

## Gameplay :
The gameplay is based around an army beseiging a town. The player's goal is to capture a specific point of the city. Both sides have a morale bar, that moves up and down depending on their actions.

The player's main action is to attack a portion of the city and destroy and raid it. The city will then rebuild itself in an attempt to resist the invasion.

After raiding a part of the city, the player will gain resources and make the city lose a source of these resources. If said resources are empty, the morale of the side will start to fade slowly.

The main challenge consists of balancing risk and resources to capture the city in a minimal amount of time.

Once a wall is completely broken, it cannot be rebuilt.

## Setup : 
The player, aka. THE BULL EMPEROR wants to take revenge on the humans.
